# MultiChannel-Time-Encoding

1. theory contains all the background theory and math. 
	It contains a .tex file and corresponding pdf.
	
2. Code contains all the codes
-Code/TEM.m contains the code for single channel Time encoding machine
	-Code/multi_TEM.m contains code for multi_channel Time encoding machine
	 Code/iter_recon.m contains the code for reconstruction of a signal encoded by a single channel TEM
	 Code/multi_iter_recon.m contains the code for reconstruction of a signal encoded by a M-channel TEM
	 single_channel.m , multi_channel.m are scripts for running the functions
	 
3. Results folder contains the plots of original,encoded,reconstructed,error for different signals.
